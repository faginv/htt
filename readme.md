How To: Tabs
============

This is the source code for the ["How To: Tabs" series](http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/episodes/how_to) of James Shore's [Let's Code: Test-Driven JavaScript screencast](http://www.letscodejavascript.com).

"How To: Tabs" is focused on showing beginning programmers how work is done in a professional environment. It's best for people who have learned the basics of programming (variables, loops, etc.) but are just starting their professional career.

The series covers a wide range of topics, including:

* Version control
* Reproducible builds
* Static code analysis (linting)
* Cross-browser testing
* JavaScript modules
* Test-driven development of front-end code
* The Document Object Model
* Design and Refactoring

In the series, we use these techniques to develop a basic tab-switching effect. This repository contains the source code developed in the series.
